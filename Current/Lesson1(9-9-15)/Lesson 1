Lesson 1

1. Set up development environment.
	- Talk about XCode (install on your own time if you haven't already)
	
	- Discuss Simulator / iPhone Deployment
		-Demo

	- Mention Apple Developer Program Membership
		- You will need this to publish apps to the store or to deploy apps to a physical device. Otherwise, you may develop with the simulator for free.

	- Talk about Objective-C vs. Swift.
		- I use Objective-C. They both get the job done. APIs are provided for both languages. Which language you choose doesn't change how you do things, just what your syntax looks like.

	- Mention The Big Nerd Ranch Guide to iOS Programming 

2. GitHub
	- Our repo is:

	https://github.com/hoo-apps/iOS-Lessons

	- Look in Current Folder for lessons

	You may access GitHub files in three ways:
	1) Go to the website in a web browser and download files manually
		(this is not recommended but it will work)
	2) Create a local repository on your PC and run command line
		git commands to sync up your local version with the master branch
	3) Download an application to help you manage Git repositories. If you choose this route, I recommend using SourceTree.

	-Demo

3. Name Game
	-Today, we will begin from scratch on the name game. Follow along and
	we'll see how far we get. I will post a snapshot of the code after the lesson is complete.
