Lesson2 --> Go over NameGame code and then add tweaks/features as time allows. Talk about Swift.

Topics:
1) TabBarController, NavigationBarController
2) Model-View-Controller-Store design pattern
3) Model objects and NSKeyedArchiving for data persistence
4) User Interface Layout
5) Tips and Tricks along the way

How this project got started:

1. SetUp UI Architecture (Featuring Tab Bar Controller and Navigation Controller)
	Create New Swift Project
	
	Set up Storyboard with Initial View Controller as Tab Bar Controller
	
	Drop in two navigation controllers and hook up to tab bar controller, giving it two tabs.
	(Note hold control and click drag from tab bar controller to nav controller, then establish
	the relationship segue connection called 'view controllers' to add a tab)

	Verify that each nav controller has a root view controller. Delete the auto-generated root-view
	controllers and drop in two generic View Controllers, attaching them to nav controllers as root
	view controllers. (Again control and click drag from nav controller to root view controller to 
	establish the relationship segue called root view controller) 

	Create a 'show' transition to a detail view controller (drop in another generic view 
	controller, control click drag from master to detail) for the second root view controller.

	Click on this transition (called a segue) and name it 'GameToResults' so we can reference
	it in our code.

	Name Tab 1 "Game" and Tab 2 "Stats"
	
	Test to verify working UI flow with simulator or on device

2. Create HOOGameViewController, HOOResultsViewController, HOOStatsViewController files
(New>File>Cocoa Touch Class> Inherit from ViewController>Language = Swift)

In storyboard, link each view controller by clicking on yellow circle and typing in the 
appropriate class in the class text box under the identity inspector (3rd icon on right drawer)

3. Create HOOPlayer, HOOPerson, and HOODataStore files (same as above except inherit from NSObject)
